# CTB - Custom Taxonomy Builder

## Description

Given a list of terms and a set of UMLS files, the CTB generates a
subset the of UMLS containing the supplied terms and their word-based
variants.

## Inputs

The following files should be placed in the data/input directory:

+ MRCONSO.RRF concepts file
+ MRSTY.RRF concept -> semantic types file

Supplied to Web Interface

+ list of supplied terms

## Outputs

+ Custom version of mrconso.rrf
+ Custom version of mrsty.rrf

## Usage

To use CTB you must first create indexes of your UMLS files and then
start the tool.

### Prepare Knowledge Sources

Copy MRCONSO.RRF, MRSTY.RRF to ctb/data/input/'your data set name'/.

In the ctb directory run:

    bin/prepumls.sh 'your data set name'

For example:

    bin/prepumls.sh 2016AA

### Start up system

In the top-level ctb directory run:

    java -jar target/ctb-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar <port>

or if you have Leiningen:

    lein ring server 

Then point your web browser to localhost:3000 (or if you supplied a
port number, that port number.)

### Supply Term List

Paste your term list into the "Input Terms" (first) page and press
"Submit".

### Filter synonyms

Select or de-select terms in Synonym Set View to filter the synonyms
generated by the tool and press "Submit".

### Generate Data Set

The generated dataset will be placed in the directory
resources/public/output/user<number>/<queryhash>/.

The directory should contain the following files:

    filtered-synset
    filtered-termlist.edn
    mrconso.rrf
    mrsty.rrf
    params
    synonymsp.checksum
    termlist

## For Developers

### Running the system in Apache Tomcat

If you have tomcat you can use the file
target/ctb-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.war to deploy the system to
tomcat.

Currently, the application expects the config directory containing
ctb.properties and the data directory containing the indexes to be in
the top-level apache-tomcat directory (where directories conf,
webapps, etc. resides)

Note: CTB has not been extensively tested in Tomcat and may require
modification to work properly.
